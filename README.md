## Ayo Niyi Frontend Task

I implemented the design using Nextjs 14.1, Typescript, Tailwind & shadcn components.

## Features of the page

The form on the page was implemented with shadcn components and react-hook-form, it also has some validations thanks to zod.

An image can be uploaded with the "change photo" button or by dragging and dropping an image on the image upload circle. The drag and drop functionality was implemented with the help of react-dropzone package.

The form states whether inputs are valid via error messages or a toast when the save changes button is clicked.

The page is also responsive.
